This project focuses on the end-to-end analysis and visualization of ecommerce customer purchase data. It begins with a raw dataset containing 10,000 ecommerce transactions and progresses through the full data pipeline:

ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning
Irrelevant and sensitive fields (e.g. credit card numbers, IP addresses) are removed. Duplicate entries are dropped, text fields are standardized (e.g. lowercasing emails), and the dataset is transformed into a clean, analysis-ready format.

ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key insights are extracted to understand customer behavior, such as:

Average purchase price

Most common languages and job titles

AM vs PM purchase distribution

Top companies by purchase value

Preferred credit card providers

ðŸ“ˆ Interactive Dashboard (Dash + Plotly)
A dynamic dashboard is built using Dash and Plotly, allowing users to explore the insights visually. The dashboard includes:

Summary metrics

Bar, pie, line, and column charts

Custom CSS styling for a polished UI

This project demonstrates how to go from raw data to a fully functional interactive product, making it suitable for business intelligence, data storytelling, or showcasing data science skills.
